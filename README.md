The PyCity Schools Analysis below provides an overview on schools in a district. The schools in the district were gaged on performance, budget, school size and number of students. Two conclusions that were made due to the calculations below include:

1. Budget per Students plays a key role:
• The schools were separated in ranges per student: <$585, $585-$630, $630-$645 and $645-680.
• Students that attended schools with smaller budgets ($585 and $585-$630) outperformed their counterparts with higher budgets in math and reading scores. 
• The schools with higher budgets per student tended to have more students than the lower budget schools. 
•As the budget per school increases the math, reading, and overall passing rates decreased.
•Math is a subject that all budget groups struggled with, as math tested the lowest among all budgets. 
•Charter schools spent less per students but passing rates were higher than the district schools.

2. School size contributes to student success:
• The analysis categorized school size by three ranges: <1000 students (small), 1000-2000 students (medium), and 2000-5000 (large).
•Smaller schools outperformed larger schools academically in math, reading and overall passing rate. 
•Per the data it can be determined that the larger the school the lower the passing rates will be. 
•Charter schools had the least amount of students compared to district schools. 
•The largest schools (by student) in the district posted the lowest overall passing rates. 

The conclusions above are all based off of the data below. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation in the district, one should consider additional context and possibly undertake further investigation.
